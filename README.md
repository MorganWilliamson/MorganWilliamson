### Hi there! My name is Morgan, I'm a software developer based in Arkansas. ðŸ‘‹

**MorganWilliamson/MorganWilliamson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m primarily working in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node, while learning about a variety of languages, frameworks, and libraries along the way.
- âœ¨ When I'm not coding, I love reading (feel free to send me recommendations!), hiking the local trails, and playing tabletop games with friends.
