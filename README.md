### Hi there! My name is Morgan, I'm a full-stack web developer based in Arkansas. ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**MorganWilliamson/MorganWilliamson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m actively searching for a job in software development! My dream job would be within the tech, film, or media sectors, but I'm always excited to see what possibilities are out there!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m primarily working in JavaScript, React/Redux, Node/Express, and Python, and dabbling in random languages, frameworks, and libraries along the way. 
- ðŸ“« [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-t-williamson/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MorganW_dev) are the best places to get ahold of me!
- âœ¨ When I'm not coding, I love reading (feel free to send me recommendations!), hiking the local trails, and (virtually!) playing tabletop games with friends.
